===============================

Game must be run on the web server to have sound support. 
You can check the demo at: http://apps.krevh.com/frogger/
When game is started, you are presented with a simple game menu
with two options:
START
RESUME

The only difference between them is that RESUME does not reset your score.

Goal of the game is to reach the water, without the bugs getting you. 
When you reach the water, you win 2 points. When bugs get you, you loose a point.
Good luck!
